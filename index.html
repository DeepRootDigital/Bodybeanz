				<p class="second-section-about">Doesn&#39;t superfood nutrition sound better than chemical nutrition? Most vitamin/supplement brands are man-made crystalline chemical isolates, not organically whole vitamins you find in real food. And guess what? They&#39;re often derived from petroleum extracts, coal tar derivatives, and other industrial chemical by-products. Amazing! Just think...this is the very thing you take daily to &quot;supplement&quot; your diet for maximum health. Is that what you want to be taking?</p>
				<div class="second-section-lists">
					<div class="left-list list-style">
						<p class="list-intro">Look at the labels of many products and you will see all sorts of chemical sounding names like:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Ascorbic acid</li>
							<li>D-Alpha Tocopheryl Succinate</li>
							<li>Sodium Benzoate</li>
							<li>Magnesium Oxide</li>
							<li>Chromium Chloride</li>
							<li>Pyridoxine Hydrochloride</li>
							<li>and that&#39;s just a few of the dozens you may find</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="second-section-bottom-info">In short, if it sounds like a chemical, it is. Wouldnâ€™t you feel better being able to pronounce the ingredients in 
							your vitamin and supplement bottles?</p>

						<p>Inorganic man-made synthetic chemical vitamins and supplements are not whole. They lack the natural enzymes, phytonutrients and trace minerals found in whole foods and therefore are called isolates. Your body needs these co-factors to digest, absorb, and utilize nutrients optimally. Without them you put stress on your body as it tries to use its own internal resources to make them into a &quot;whole&quot; form it recognizes. But when your body can&#39;t absorb the synthetic chemical isolates, they just go through you. What&#39;s the point of that?</p>
